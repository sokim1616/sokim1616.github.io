A former student of ***Code States*** gave a lecture about the importance of blogging, continuously.
It was an issue that I was concerned about during the 20-weeks of the bootcamp.
I was not so sure if I could find the time to write a blog about what I learned that day, while keeping up with the sprint which had to be finished in such short amount of time, compared to my level of knowledge.

The Code States-graduate was now an employee in a company which makes a service, similar to ***Netflix***, called ***Watcha***.
She said blogging consecutively was the biggest benefit of getting hired in such a company.
Now that I think about it, I think I ran into her blog as well, while I was googling through, searching for some nice information about a concept I was confused about.

So after today's lecture, I reminded myself that it is not too late to begin again at this moment.

I did some blogging about basic concepts like the different methods of array, for loop, Object-oriented Programming (OOP), and so on.
>My goal is to write some Dev diaries, like this, as a Today-I-Learned (TIL) format to keep a record of what I learned that day.
>From time to time, I'm also planning to translate some other helpful blogs, that are written in English into my mother language, Korean. I hope my blog would benefit some other people in the future.

I'm glad that I attended the lecture today. It provoked me in a positive way.
