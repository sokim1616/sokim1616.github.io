A few days ago, I was working on my project that I have been working on as a final project during the boot camp, called **Memory.log**.
It's still in the process of being refactored and deployed, but I will write about how the project has been going on during the given 4 weeks.

**Memory.log** is a mobile application where photographic users can use while traveling.

As a person who likes to take pictures, I often wondered what I've been thinking when I was taking picture of a certain scene, when looking back at the pictures after time has passed.
Everytime I travel, I would TRY to write a journal every night before going to bed, but it never worked out until the last day of the travel.
So I wished if there was an application where I can take a picture and record my thoughts the same time, so that I can keep the moment as a clear memory, even after years have passed.

Ok, that got a little emotional.

Anyways, the idea is that as soon as you turn on the application, the camera will appear so that you can take a picture of a scenery that you want to keep as a "memory".
As soon as the photo is taken, the app screen will be shifted to a note-taking page. This is where you can write your thoughts about the picture you just took!
You can just write a short phrase about what you were thinking, and why you wanted to keep it as your memory, and save it!
..which will go into this place called, "Memory Storage". It is just another page that stores all the pictures you have taken, so that you can always come back and see them.


I had that idea in mind, and presented it to my boot camp mates. I was assigned three other students to be my team mates,and we were on board for the 4-weeks of final project, before the end of the boot camp.
