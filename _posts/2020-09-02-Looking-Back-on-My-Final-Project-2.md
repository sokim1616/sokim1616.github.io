On the first two days of the project, we spent a long time organizing what was called **SR (Software Requirement)**.
The idea was to plan out the specific tasks that should be done, in order to have a strong base before actually coding.

I learned that the more specific the SR is, the more helpful it is during the project.
At first we planned to use different kinds of stacks, in order to learn about things that we haven't had a chance to study.
The stacks that we decided to newly use included **Python, Django** and **Firebase** in back-end, and **Typescript** and **React Navigation** in front-end.
We decided to learn them until the first weekend, and see if we can carry out with these stacks.

However, we met the first obstacle during the process.
For some reason, I could not get the newest version of Django installed in my computer. I spent two whole days of the weekend trying to solve this issue.
But when I finally got the installation ready, it was already the evening of Sunday, and I haven't had a chance to learn the language itself!
Since the app should be presented in **YouTube live** in 4 weeks, we decided as a team to stay safe and use the stack we have been using before, which were **Node.js, Express** and **Sequelize**.

I was assigned a full-stack, beginning with the back-end moving to the front, because the app had bigger proportion on the client side. So from the third day we started coding, and I worked on the receiving the signin and login information of the user, and passing them on to the client side, using **Express** session.

After that task, I was moved to the front-end in order to support my team mates on the client side.
