On the first two days of the project, we spent a long time organizing what was called **SR (Software Requirement)**.
The idea was to plan out the specific tasks that should be done, in order to have a strong base before actually coding.

I was assigned a full-stack, beginning with the back-end moving to the front, because the app had bigger proportion on the client side. So from the third day we started coding, and I worked on the receiving the signin and login information of the user, and passing them on to the client side, using **Express** session.
