When I moved to the client-side, my other front-end team mates have already laid out the general organization of the **Typescript** coding.
So my job was to use the **React Native** and **React Navigation** in order to create a ***Friend List*** page where a app user can add other app users as friends, using the already-structured-out **Typescript**.

Here I faced the second obstacle. I did not learn about **Typescript** before, and there were not enough time for me to "master" it before using it, if not understanding it at the least.

My initial plan was to learn it and use it at the same time, but I found out after the setting up the general "type" of the codes, it is not necessary for me to work with **Typescript** when I'm creating a screen like the ***Friend List***.
So I began working on my task.

But as I typed my codes, I realized that there were red lines everywhere...
It was telling me that my code did not follow the "type" that was set up by my other team mate.

I did not know how to read the codes that were written with the **Typescript** format, so I just ran the simulator no matter the red lines.
Guess what?
The simulator ran fine without any errors!

The reason is because the "**Typescript** red lines" are just telling me that there are errors in the structure of the code, but it is NOT grammatically incorrect so the code runs just fine.

In the process of trying to figure out the problem, I learned that **Typescript** is usually helpful when the project is much larger, for example in an actual IT company. 
This is because when there are a lot of programmers, working towards the same goal, it can be difficult to control everyone's codes. So the idea of **Typescript** is to set a rule so that what each programmer writes can be consistent with the rest of the team members.

Which means that there was no need for our little team of four to be using **Typescript**!
But the overall goal of the project was to learn new things, isn't that right?
And **Typescript** is popular among many IT companies nowadays, so it was a good experience to learn it during my final project! :)
