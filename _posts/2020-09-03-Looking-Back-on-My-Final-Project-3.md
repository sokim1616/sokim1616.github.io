When I moved to the client-side, my other front-end team mates have already laid out the general organization of the **Typescript** coding.
So my job was to use the **React Native** and **React Navigation** in order to create a ***Friend List*** page where a app user can add other app users as friends, using the already-structured-out **Typescript**.

Here I faced the second obstacle. I did not learn about **Typescript** before, and there were not enough time for me to "master" it before using it, if not understanding it at the least.

My initial plan was to learn it and use it at the same time, but I found out after the setting up the general "type" of the codes, it is not necessary for me to work with **Typescript** when I'm creating a screen like the ***Friend List***.
So I began working on my task.

But as I typed my codes, I realized that there were red lines everywhere...
It was telling me that my code did not follow the "type" that was set up by my other team mate.

I did not know how to read the codes that were written with the **Typescript** format, so I just ran the simulator no matter the red lines.
Guess what?
The simulator ran fine without any errors!
