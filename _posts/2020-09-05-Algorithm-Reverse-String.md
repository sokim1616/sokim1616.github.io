Today's algorithm problem was called **Reverse String** from ***leetcode***.
The title of the problem is pretty straight-forward, but the main goal is to reverse a given string.

For example, a given string "Hello" has to be returned as "olleH".

This was the code that I had to start with:
```
var reverseString = function(s) {

}
```
where 's' is the given string.
