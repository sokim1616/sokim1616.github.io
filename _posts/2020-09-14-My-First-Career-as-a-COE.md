After completing the 20-week course of programming in **Codestates**, I have applied to work in the company myself.
Originally, **Codestates** had the trend of hiring some of their students as the CSE, which were **Codestates** graduates that academically helped the current students in the course.
However, beginning with our class (Immersive 20), a new position called COE was created.
COE, or Codestates Operation Engineer, was basically a position that worked on organizing and counseling the current students who might be having difficult times.
Also, as time passes the number of **Codestates** students are increasing, so it is necessary to divide up a class into several sub-classes in order to take care of each and every one of the students.

And this is the position that I applied for.

I cannot say the every detail of the employment process (due to the confidentiality issue), but I passed through three steps before I made it to the finals and became a member of the **Codestates** family!

I will continue with how my Day 1 has passed in the up-coming blog! :)
