9th of September, 2020
was the first day of my career as an engineer! 

After a brief onboarding about the company and the job, COEs (**Codestates** Operation Engineers) have met with the other crew members in the **Organizaiton Cell** to talk about our role.
As I mentioned in the earlier post, COE was a newly-born position where me and my two other colleagues were the pioneers!
So our first assignment was to think of what kind of assignments we can do as COE.

Before getting accepted to this job our assignment, as an applicant, was to suggest an idea to improve the organization of the students who are taking the course. And now that there are more students than ever, a thorough plan needs to be programmed in order to run the business AND to take care of each student.

My suggestion was to develop a tab on the website that shows a list of companies that are in partnership with **Codestates** to the students. Currently, there is a tab that has a similar contents but the target audience is other companies, attracting them to be in a partnership with us. However, I thought a page for students would also help them search for a job after completing the course.
So I made a brief overview of what the page would look like and presented it during the interview.
That was one thing that I wanted to suggest to **Codestates**.

But as a graduate of the bootcamp, I wanted to look for a way to interact with the current students who are taking the course so that I can empathize with them and to give suggestions as a former-student who went through the same process.
So my main goal is to find a way to talk with the students and also search for students who seem like they are having some difficulty, but are not brave enough to tell it in front of the whole classmates.

I'm looking forward to what I can contribute to **Codestates** and the students of **Codestates**.
I will have to take notes of every idea that comes into my mind in order to do so! :)

In the next post, I will write about some of the basic concepts of JavaScript!
See you soon :)
