9th of September, 2020
was the first day of my career as an engineer! 

After a brief onboarding about the company and the job, COEs (**Codestates** Operation Engineers) have met with the other crew members in the **Organizaiton Cell** to talk about our role.
As I mentioned in the earlier post, COE was a newly-born position where me and my two other colleagues were the pioneers!
So our first assignment was to think of what kind of assignments we can do as COE.
