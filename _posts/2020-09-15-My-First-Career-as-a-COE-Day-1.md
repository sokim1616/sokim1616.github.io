9th of September, 2020
was the first day of my career as an engineer! 

After a brief onboarding about the company and the job, COEs (**Codestates** Operation Engineers) have met with the other crew members in the **Organizaiton Cell** to talk about our role.
As I mentioned in the earlier post, COE was a newly-born position where me and my two other colleagues were the pioneers!
So our first assignment was to think of what kind of assignments we can do as COE.

Before getting accepted to this job our assignment, as an applicant, was to suggest an idea to improve the organization of the students who are taking the course. And now that there are more students than ever, a thorough plan needs to be programmed in order to run the business AND to take care of each student.
