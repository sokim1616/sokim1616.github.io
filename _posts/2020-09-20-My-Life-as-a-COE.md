Last Friday was my first time counseling a student taking the course in **Codestates**.
Actually, I was assigned to meet with two students from the class of 'Full Immersive 22'. They recently tokk the final exam, called Hiring Assessment (HA), before going into the project. But in the process, almost half of the class seemed to have difficulty with the exam so they were all asked to attend a counseling session with us, the operation team.
