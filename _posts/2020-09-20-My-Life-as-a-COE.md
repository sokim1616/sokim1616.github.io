Last Friday was my first time counseling a student taking the course in **Codestates**.
Actually, I was assigned to meet with two students from the class of 'Full Immersive 22'. They recently tokk the final exam, called Hiring Assessment (HA), before going into the project. But in the process, almost half of the class seemed to have difficulty with the exam so they were all asked to attend a counseling session with us, the operation team.

As said earlier, each of the COE were assigned to take care of two students.
The final HA was all about creating both the client-side and the server-side and connecting them like a real web page.
And our task was to look over the video that the students, who couldn't pass the test, filmed while describing how they wrote the codes and showing the outcome of the code on the web page.
After the examination of the video, we were to decide whether this student can participate in the project, or take a step backward and to join the next class and review the sprints.
As for the class of 'Full Immersive 22', the students did not have enough time to go over the ***React*** sprint, so unluckily almost all of them had to be considered taking the latter option.

So on Friday, I met with the students separately, and started off with asking how they feel about the HA and about going to the project. In the process, I listened to their concerns and about what kind of things are going through their heads right now.
As for the security issue, I cannot reveal the every detail of the conversation, but I had empathy towards the students because I went through the exact same process and I understand how hard it is to keep up with such an intense schedule among other people who are "good" at writing the codes.

I told them that I also had the same experience, and I sincerely told them how much they can improve if they were to review the sprints again.
Thankfully they, too, felt that I was being genuine with them so they agreed to start off with the later class as well.

At first I was nervous about meeting the students, but through this task I was able to really help them person-to-person, and I also learned what I need to improve on: understanding certain code or a concept deep enough so that I can explain it to some other person.

I know what my goal is for the upcoming days! :)
